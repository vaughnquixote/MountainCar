# Mountain Car
This repo houses a set of python scripts which provide multiple solutions to the classic mountain car problem in reinforcement learning. I chose to work with the mountain car environment provided by OpenAi Gym. The basic task is for a small car to drive itself up a steep hill. The car begins in a valley and does not generate enough force to drive directly to the top of the hill. The only way for it to reach the top is by driving back and forth, leveraging its potential energy and applying force in the right moments.

I completed this as an indpendent project as a part of the Foundations of AI course while pursuing a master's degree in CS at Northeastern University.
